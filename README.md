# Movie-Dataset-Project
Utilized dataset scraped from IMDb movie database and used Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit Learn, and Matplotlib to effectively visualize the data and predict the effects of features such as movie budget, production company, country of origin, genre, revenue, release date, run time, etc. on the success of a movie.
This project provided insight on how aspects of a movieâ€™s production impact the gross revenue and the trends of movie genres over the years based on viewer ratings.
